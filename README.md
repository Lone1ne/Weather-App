## Description

The Weather Application provides users with current and 5-day forecast weather conditions for a specific city. The user enters a city name into a search field, and the application presents current weather conditions for that city, including the city name, date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## User Story

```

## Acceptance Criteria
